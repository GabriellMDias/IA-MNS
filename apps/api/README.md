# API Runtime

[Setup](../../docs/setup.md) · [API principles](../../docs/api/principles.md) · [OpenAPI](../../docs/generated/api/openapi.json) · [Validation](../../docs/validation.md)

The Fastify API runtime provides configuration, structured logging and tracing, health/lifecycle behavior, the public error envelope, optional PostgreSQL access through Prisma, and optional bearer access-token verification. Product capabilities are [modules](#modules) composed in [`src/modules.ts`](src/modules.ts). The [web application](../web/README.md) consumes the generated API contract through the workspace SDK package (`packages/sdk`). The API verifies access tokens; it does not implement login, passwords, refresh tokens, or provider-specific sessions.

## Modules

IA-MNS composes the [identity module](src/features/identity/module.ts), the [corporate agent](src/features/agent/module.ts) and the [sales capability](src/features/sales/capability.ts). Identity owns Persons, local accounts, PDT Connect and Sankhya links, sessions, the access-token issuer, the grantable permission catalog declared in `src/modules.ts`, and `/identity` operations ([identity domain](../../docs/domains/identity.md)). The agent owns PostgreSQL conversations/turns, a registered-capability router, actual progress and `/agent` operations. Sales retains strict interpretation, the source orchestration, controlled read-only queries (Oracle for Sankhya, PostgreSQL for VRMaster) and deterministic calculations. Legacy `/sales` endpoints remain for first-MVP compatibility. [Agent architecture](../../docs/domains/corporate-agent.md), [sales semantics](../../docs/domains/sales-chat.md) and [local setup](../../docs/setup.md#corporate-agent-and-local-postgresql) are canonical. Production requires PostgreSQL, OpenAI and authentication; local availability remains explicit when dependencies are absent. The agent validates its required table projection before startup; no migration is applied by the runtime.

A module is one cohesive API capability. It implements the `ApiModule` contract in [`src/module.ts`](src/module.ts): a name, an OpenAPI tag, its requirements (`database`, `authentication`), its executable operations, its public error codes, and an `activate` function that mounts routes once its requirements are configured. Shared runtime files never import a module; [`src/modules.ts`](src/modules.ts) is the only composition point, and dependency rules enforce that boundary.

Keep a module's files together under its name: `src/features/<module>/` for domain, application, persistence, contracts, routes, and errors; `prisma/schema/<module>.prisma` for its models; `prisma/metadata/<module>.json` for table meaning; `prisma/runtime-grants/<module>.sql` for least-privilege runtime access; a reviewed migration; tests under `test/<module>/`; and an optional emitted-process smoke at `scripts/smoke/<module>.ts`. Follow [application boundaries](../../docs/architecture/application-boundaries.md), [dependency rules](../../docs/architecture/dependency-rules.md), and the [database policies](../../docs/database/principles.md). [Orion's reference implementation](../../docs/project-derivation.md#orions-reference-implementation) is a complete example.

Outside production, a module whose requirements are not configured stays unmounted. In production, startup fails instead, so a composed capability cannot silently disappear. Generated OpenAPI and the public error registry always include every composed module, whether or not it is configured locally.

## Local commands

Use [setup](../../docs/setup.md) for the frozen install, generated Prisma client, environment loading, containers, and startup order. `pnpm -C apps/api dev` loads the ignored root `.env.local` when present; `start` runs emitted code and expects its process environment without loading that file.

From the repository root:

| Purpose | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Provision local durable Docker PostgreSQL and apply migrations/grants | `pnpm db:local` |
| Apply migrations and runtime grants with `ORION_MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL`, then verify the runtime role's privileges | `pnpm -C apps/api db:deploy` |
| Validate the configuration, the files it names and the production module requirements without listening | `pnpm -C apps/api config:check` |
| Write new identity signing/encryption keys to a new owner-only file | `pnpm identity:keys --output <file>` |
| Generate ignored Prisma client | `pnpm -C apps/api db:generate` |
| Apply committed migrations to the configured database | `pnpm -C apps/api db:migrate:deploy` |
| Check API behavior/types | `pnpm -C apps/api test` and `pnpm -C apps/api typecheck` |
| Evaluate AI behavior (scripted by default; `--subject model` uses the live provider) | `pnpm eval run` |
| Emit/start API | `pnpm -C apps/api build`, then `pnpm -C apps/api start` |
| Intentionally regenerate tracked API/database/configuration/error references | `pnpm -C apps/api references:write` |

The emitted build carries the same operational commands as `dist/cli/*.js` (`identity-bootstrap`, `identity-keys`, `config-check`, `database-deploy`), which need neither `tsx` nor the source tree; a deployment runs them with `node` beside the server ([ADR-0029](../../docs/adr/0029-serve-the-web-and-api-from-one-origin-behind-restricted-trusted-proxies.md)). Only `database-deploy` (and the Prisma CLI it runs) reads `ORION_MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL`; it needs the Prisma CLI installed beside the build.
| Check current API/database/SDK references without editing them | `pnpm references:check` |

Tests and reference generation use fresh migrated Testcontainers PostgreSQL, so a compatible container runtime must be reachable. Follow the [artifact workflow](../../docs/architecture/backend-execution-and-generated-artifacts.md) for downstream SDK/portal generation after source changes. The root `pnpm validate` also checks emitted builds, real-process recovery, and browser behavior; a focused package check alone does not replace it.

## Configuration and database access

[`config.ts`](src/config.ts) is the sole runtime environment parser; the [generated configuration reference](../../docs/generated/configuration/api.md) owns the setting catalog. `ORION_ENV` is always required. `ORION_DATABASE_URL` enables the database for modules that require it and adds a bounded database check to readiness. `ORION_TOKEN_ISSUER`, `ORION_TOKEN_AUDIENCE`, and `ORION_TOKEN_JWKS_URL` enable bearer authentication and must be configured together.

`ORION_DATABASE_URL` is the restricted runtime credential. Only migration tooling (the Prisma CLI and the [database deployment step](src/database-deploy.ts)) reads `ORION_MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL`, supplied separately for migration commands; neither loads the API's root `.env.local`. The server, the bootstrap and the configuration check delete it from their environment. Keep both out of tracked files and do not leave the migration credential in the runtime environment.

The runtime role `orion_runtime` needs `CONNECT`, `USAGE` on the application schema plus only the table privileges that each module declares in `prisma/runtime-grants/`. It needs no DDL grant. The database deployment step applies the migrations, grants exactly those privileges, and fails when the role is missing, has an administrative attribute, may create or owns objects, or holds a table privilege no grant declares; it never creates roles or sets passwords. `pnpm db:local` and the [database fixture](scripts/migrated-database.ts) create the role, then run that same step, so local and integration databases match production privileges.

The [release workflow](../../docs/database/release-evolution.md) owns durable migration recording. An empty registry is not permission to rewrite unverified history.

## Identity and contract

The shared [token verifier](src/authentication.ts) accepts verified `at+jwt` tokens signed with RS256 or ES256 by the configured issuer for the configured audience. It validates expiration and requires nonempty `sub`, valid issuance/expiry timing, a stable `orion_principal_id` UUID, `orion_actor_type=human`, and a string `scope`. It yields the principal ID and the issuer-granted scopes; each module maps scopes to its own capabilities. Stored ownership must survive provider changes; request bodies cannot grant identity or capability. The [authentication policy](../../docs/security/authentication.md) and [ADR-0012](../../docs/adr/0012-verify-jwt-access-tokens-at-the-first-api-boundary.md) govern this boundary. When `IA_MNS_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` and the identity keys are configured, `main.ts` also trusts the in-process IA-MNS issuer, whose public key is derived from `IA_MNS_IDENTITY_SIGNING_KEY` ([ADR-0022](../../docs/adr/0022-own-the-ia-mns-identity-with-verified-external-links.md)); an external issuer configured with the `ORION_TOKEN_*` settings can coexist.

Executable module contracts own operations, stable operation IDs, typed inputs/outputs, and expected failures. The [OpenAPI reference](../../docs/generated/api/openapi.json) includes health and every composed module's operations; the [error reference](../../docs/generated/api/errors.md) derives from the shared and module registries.

## Request protection

A module that exposes authenticated routes should apply request limiting before token verification and database access, as the reference module does with a process-local source-IP limit; health probes stay outside it. Exhaustion returns `429 RATE_LIMITED` in the public envelope with a bounded `Retry-After`. This is resource protection, not a product quota.

Process-local limiting uses the client address Fastify derives. By default that is the direct peer. Behind a reverse proxy, `ORION_TRUSTED_PROXIES` lists the exact proxy addresses (or IPv4 /24, IPv6 /64 and narrower ranges) whose `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` are honored, so each client keeps its own limit and no other peer can choose its address; wildcards and broad networks are refused ([ADR-0029](../../docs/adr/0029-serve-the-web-and-api-from-one-origin-behind-restricted-trusted-proxies.md)). Identity never derives origins, redirects or cookie security from forwarded headers. A multi-replica deployment must still define shared or edge limiting before promising fleet-wide limits.

## Same-origin web hosting

With `ORION_WEB_ROOT` set to a built `apps/web`, the process serves it at the same origin ([ADR-0029](../../docs/adr/0029-serve-the-web-and-api-from-one-origin-behind-restricted-trusted-proxies.md), [`web-hosting.ts`](src/web-hosting.ts)):

- The build is indexed at startup; only exact files are served, hashed `/assets/*` as immutable, everything else `no-cache`. A page navigation that matches no file receives `index.html`; missing assets, unknown API paths and non-GET requests receive the JSON error envelope.
- Module operations move under `/api`, the browser path the development proxy strips. Health probes answer at `/health/*` and `/api/health/*`. Without `ORION_WEB_ROOT` nothing moves.
- Responses carry `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` (same-origin `fetch()` writes keep their real `Origin`) and `frame-ancestors 'none'`, except `/embed/pdt` and `/embed/sankhya`, which allow only `PDT_EMBED_ORIGIN` and `SANKHYA_EMBED_ORIGIN`.
- The build manifest says whether it contains the `/docs` portal; the process refuses such a build unless `ORION_WEB_DOCS=enabled`, which is the default outside production only.
- `ORION_TLS_CERT_FILE` and `ORION_TLS_KEY_FILE` make the listener HTTPS for an encrypted proxy-to-application hop.

## Lifecycle and diagnostics

`main.ts` validates configuration, initializes Pino/OpenTelemetry, loads the files the configuration names (TLS material, web build), then dynamically imports Fastify, Prisma, and composed modules before listening; [`composition.ts`](src/composition.ts) builds token verification and activates modules for both the server and `config-check`. Preserve that order for instrumented infrastructure. Incoming W3C trace context propagates; each request receives a fresh server-generated `x-request-id`. Errors follow the [public envelope](../../docs/api/error-contract.md). Logs and traces identify the service by the API package name.

Startup reports initialization, liveness reports process-local health, and readiness becomes unavailable while draining or when a configured database is unavailable. A configured database is probed before readiness and through a bounded readiness check. SIGINT/SIGTERM trigger bounded HTTP, database, and telemetry shutdown.

Logs and exported spans/metric dimensions use allowlisted operational fields. The runtime does not log payloads, raw URLs, headers, configuration objects, or arbitrary exception messages. Unexpected failures produce one sanitized diagnostic occurrence. A readiness failure or a lost response cannot prove that a prior write failed; see [delivery and side effects](../../docs/architecture/delivery-and-side-effects.md).
