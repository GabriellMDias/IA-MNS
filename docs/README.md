# Documentation Task Index

Choose the route relevant to the change, then use the policy's headings and source links for focused reading. Related policies apply when the change crosses their boundaries. The repository has an API runtime with composable modules and PostgreSQL support, a generated SDK, and a web application shell with this portal; the README's [Current state](../README.md#current-state) says which modules this repository composes. [Selected technologies](architecture/technology-decisions.md) are not proof of [implemented commands](validation.md).

## Find the smallest useful context

1. Read the root and applicable nested `AGENTS.md`, then select the task route below. Read related policies only when the change crosses their boundaries.
2. Follow the owner to its canonical source and relevant tests. For a complete implemented example, see [Orion's reference implementation](project-derivation.md#orions-reference-implementation). For commands, use [setup](setup.md) and [validation](validation.md).
3. Consult the [technology map](architecture/technology-decisions.md) and governing ADR for an architectural choice or rationale. Accepted ADRs preserve decision-time context; their future-tense examples are not current command inventories.
4. If implementation and policy disagree, record the discrepancy and resolve it within the task's scope. Do not infer that a requirement is implemented or weaken it to match a gap.

[Contributing](contributing.md#documentation-ownership) owns documentation responsibilities. The implementation plan owns execution status and the human-action checklist owns actual owner/access prerequisites; the README's [Current state](../README.md#current-state) links this repository's copies. Neither activates conditional deployment work.

## Decisions and documentation

- [ADR index](adr/README.md): significant decisions and their rationale; status belongs to each ADR.
- [ADR authoring](adr/authoring.md) and [template](adr/template.md): proposals, acceptance, historical integrity, and supersession.
- [Contributing](contributing.md): change workflow, documentation ownership, canonical sources, maintenance, and review.
- [Global agent instructions](../AGENTS.md): invariants, command availability, and conditional routes for every contributor and agent; [agent instructions](architecture/agent-instructions.md) owns tool compatibility.

Current policies describe current architectural expectations. ADRs preserve decision history; [setup](setup.md) and [release evolution](database/release-evolution.md) describe real procedures. Generated references exist for the current API, configuration, errors, database, and web components. The portal renders these sources in the existing web application. No production runbook exists without a selected environment.
