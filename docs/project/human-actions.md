# IA-MNS Human Actions

[Project plan](implementation-plan.md) · [Project derivation](../project-derivation.md) · [Secrets policy](../security/secrets-management.md)

## Purpose and current state

This checklist records IA-MNS's prerequisites that require a project-owner decision, a human-controlled account action, an unavailable privilege, or securely supplied external configuration. Every contributor or coding agent performing implementation work must maintain it and must never silently skip work because human intervention is needed.

IA-MNS (https://github.com/GabriellMDias/IA-MNS) was initialized from Orion (https://github.com/GabriellMDias/Orion). Repository settings verified for Orion—Renovate, branch protection, and security controls—do not apply to this repository; the actions below establish them here. Conditional needs such as an identity provider, durable releases, or a deployment environment become new actions when their trigger occurs.

## Maintaining this checklist

1. Inspect existing decisions, access, tools, configuration, and prior authorization before requesting human intervention. Complete authorized automation and all useful preparation first.
2. Keep one stable `PH-NN` ID per coherent action; never reuse or renumber IDs. Split broad items into independently verifiable actions as they become concrete, and add newly discovered actions immediately.
3. Every action retains its ID, checkbox, owner, status, dependency, and evidence. Active or conditional requests also need the exact action, reason, non-secret configuration names, and verification method. Use `pending`, `in progress`, `completed`, `blocked`, or `changed` consistently with the [plan](implementation-plan.md#maintaining-this-plan).
4. Before asking the user, provide a concrete request: the exact setting or decision, prepared options where appropriate, why automation cannot finish it, affected task IDs, and how completion will be checked.
5. If an action blocks work now, mark the dependent plan task `blocked`, link this entry, and surface the request to the user. Continue independent authorized work.
6. Use `[x]` and `completed` only after verification, recording safe evidence and the verification date. If direct verification is unavailable, record the limitation rather than claiming success.
7. Reopen an action with `[ ]` if later evidence invalidates completion, access expires, or configuration changes, and record why.
8. A conditional item that becomes unnecessary remains `[ ]` with status `changed`, an explicit reason, and its future trigger or replacement.

## Safe configuration handoff

- Record configuration names, required scopes, environment, purpose, non-secret resource identifiers, and secure destination. Never record passwords, tokens, API keys, connection strings containing credentials, private keys, or complete environment dumps here, in the plan, in chat, or in tracked example files.
- Name only implemented configuration keys and link the [generated configuration reference](../generated/configuration/api.md); do not invent variable names in advance.
- Humans place secrets directly into the selected protected secret store or an explicitly documented ignored local file. Contributors verify presence and authorized behavior without printing secret contents.
- Use synthetic local and test data and ephemeral credentials where possible. Production secrets must not be prerequisites for ordinary development or CI.

## PH-01

- [ ] **Create IA-MNS's repository and publish the initialized default branch.**

**Status:** pending. **Owner:** project owner or repository administrator.
**Dependency / trigger:** [PJ-01](implementation-plan.md#current-work); required before this repository has its own pull requests, CI runs, or settings.
**Request and reason:** Create an empty repository at https://github.com/GabriellMDias/IA-MNS without a generated README, license, or ignore file, then run `git push -u origin main`. Initialization configured `origin` locally but never creates remote repositories or pushes.
**Configuration:** none. Do not embed credentials in remote URLs.
**Verification:** `git ls-remote origin main` returns the local `main` commit, and `pnpm orion:check` passes in a fresh clone.
**Evidence / blocker:** Not started.

## PH-02

- [ ] **Require pull requests and the CI gate on this repository's default branch, and keep merge commits available.**

**Status:** pending. **Owner:** repository administrator.
**Dependency / trigger:** PH-01; [PJ-01](implementation-plan.md#current-work).
**Request and reason:** Protect `main`: require pull requests and the `Orion required gate` status check, block force pushes and deletion, and review bypass actors. Keep merge commits allowed and do not require linear history on `main`, because Orion upgrade pull requests must be merged with a merge commit to preserve upstream ancestry ([upgrade workflow](../project-derivation.md#upgrade-to-a-newer-orion-revision)). Branch protection is repository administration that local automation cannot perform.
**Configuration:** none beyond the repository ruleset and merge settings.
**Verification:** Read the effective rules for `main` and confirm the required check name matches [CI](../../.github/workflows/ci.yml) and that no linear-history requirement applies; confirm merge commits are allowed; a successful required-gate run appears on a pull request.
**Evidence / blocker:** Not started.

## PH-03

- [ ] **Enable Renovate for this repository.**

**Status:** pending. **Owner:** repository administrator.
**Dependency / trigger:** PH-01.
**Request and reason:** Grant the Renovate GitHub App access to https://github.com/GabriellMDias/IA-MNS so the committed [configuration](../../renovate.json) runs. App installation is an account action.
**Configuration:** none; no personal token is required.
**Verification:** Renovate opens this repository's Dependency Dashboard reflecting the committed dependencies and schedule.
**Evidence / blocker:** Not started.

## PH-04

- [ ] **Enable and verify applicable GitHub security controls.**

**Status:** pending. **Owner:** repository administrator.
**Dependency / trigger:** PH-01.
**Request and reason:** Enable available code scanning, secret scanning and push protection, dependency graph, and vulnerability alerts, and set the Actions variable `DEPENDENCY_REVIEW_ENABLED=true` so the dependency-review job runs. Record entitlement limits for this repository's visibility and plan.
**Configuration:** Actions variable `DEPENDENCY_REVIEW_ENABLED` (non-secret).
**Verification:** Inspect effective security settings and a pull-request run in which dependency review executed and the aggregate gate passed.
**Evidence / blocker:** Not started.

## PH-05

- [ ] **Define the product scope and acceptance criteria.**

**Status:** pending. **Owner:** project owner.
**Dependency / trigger:** [PJ-02](implementation-plan.md#current-work); required before product modules are implemented.
**Request and reason:** Describe the product, actors, first capabilities, data classification, identity and authorization needs, and acceptance scenarios. Agents must not invent product requirements.
**Configuration:** none.
**Verification:** Requirements are recorded in the repository and linked from the project plan.
**Evidence / blocker:** Not started.

## PH-06

- [ ] **Determine the product license before distribution requires it.**

**Status:** pending (conditional on distribution). **Owner:** project owner, with legal input when needed.
**Dependency / trigger:** Publication or distribution of IA-MNS.
**Request and reason:** Choose the license, copyright holder, and distribution model for IA-MNS's own work. Agents must not choose legal policy by assumption. Material inherited from Orion is Apache-2.0, which does not decide IA-MNS's license.
**Configuration:** none.
**Verification:** License files, the README, and publication metadata match the recorded decision.
**Evidence / blocker:** No product license selected.

## New action template

Allocate a new stable `PH-NN`; do not reuse existing IDs. Link it from the blocked or conditional plan task.

```markdown
## PH-NN

- [ ] **Concrete human action.**

**Status:** pending. **Owner:** actual person or responsible role.
**Dependency / trigger:** Linked task; whether it blocks current work.
**Request and reason:** Exact need, completed preparation, and why authorized automation cannot finish it.
**Configuration:** Exact non-secret names, minimum scopes and secure destination; never secret values. Use "none" if no configuration is needed.
**Verification:** Observable checks required before completion.
**Evidence / blocker:** Dated safe evidence, outstanding limit, or changed applicability.
